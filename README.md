- **Advanced Prediction Algorithms**:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks
  - Transformer-Based Models
  - CNN-LSTM Hybrid Models
  - GAN-Based Models
  - XGBoost
  - Stacking Ensemble Methods

- **Interactive Data Visualization**:
  - Price Trend Charts
  - Prediction Result Comparison Charts
  - Technical Indicator Charts
  - Performance Metrics Visualization

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for easy data querying, algorithm selection, and result interpretation.

- **Personalized Settings**: Customize parameters for selected algorithms to tailor predictions to preferences.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS
  - ApexCharts (for data visualization)

- **Backend**:
  - Next.js API Routes
  - Integration with financial data APIs

- **Machine Learning**:
  - TensorFlow.js for client-side predictions
  - Integration capabilities with Python-based ML services
